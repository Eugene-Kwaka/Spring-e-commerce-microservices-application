# Spring-e-commerce-microservices-application
- An e-commerce microservices application built with the Spring Framework.
- Architecture includes various microservices such as:
  * Customer
  * Product
  * Order
  * Payment
  * Notification.

- To connect all these microservices, I have configured a
  * Config-server for centralized configuration
  *  Eureka-server for service registry, discovery
  *  API Gateway for request routing.
